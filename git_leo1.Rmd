# Introduction

This is an introduction course to R- programming for those who have basics of statistics and any other programming language.


#Loading the Libraries
 In every project that you a=under take as a data analyst/scientist, it's important to note the packages that `tools` that you will need in the course of the analysis, or creating your models.
 -Hence my opinion is that you load all the required libraries at the initial stage of your  project.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

```
